# SaVaGeReplica

The purpose of this project has been to learn about child_processes on node and some front end animation techniques. 

So far, it only exists as a repository that can be cloned and `docker-compose up`-ed because I am not sure that it is worth hosting for a few reasons. 

And because of that, there are a lot of obvious things that haven't been done, because I haven't been sure whether or not the effort was worth it. 

For example, right now it works with the local filesystem to store images and serve them up. On an app intended to be used by other people I would probably use a hosting service.
